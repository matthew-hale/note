# Note
A simple tool that interacts with a notes directory, and parses notes 
based on tags or text search to show you relevant notes.

## Features

+ Uses the PARA system for tags and interfacing
+ Notes are plain text - markdown makes for easy rendering
+ Displays all tags hierarchically according to PARA

## Roadmap

+ Add basic subcommand argument structure:
    + note list
    + note search
    + etc.
